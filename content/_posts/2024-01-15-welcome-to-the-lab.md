Launching a new personal site always feels like opening a fresh notebook. The goal here is to document experiments in product design, front-end engineering, and the frameworks that keep me curious.

Over the coming weeks I'm planning to share:

- Working notes on designing resilient UI systems
- Benchmarks from performance audits and the trade-offs they highlight
- Periodic retros on projects that taught me something unexpected

Thanks for stopping by. If there's a topic you'd like to read about, drop me a message and let me know.
