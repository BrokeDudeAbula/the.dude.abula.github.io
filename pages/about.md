I craft digital products with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and personality. Over the last few years I've worn hats as a product designer, front-end engineer, mentor, and all-around tinkerer.

When I'm not iterating on product ideas, you'll likely find me experimenting with generative art, curating playlists, or learning a new recipe.

### Principles I Work By

- **Start with people.** Empathy and curiosity lead to the best decisions.
- **Stay reliable.** Ship when you say you will, and communicate early when you cannot.
- **Embrace learning.** Every project is a chance to explore new ideas, patterns, or tools.
